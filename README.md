### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from Grand Rapids, MI, I've been programming since 2001 when I was in high school and professionally since 2009. I first started with web design, then moved into web development and now I've moved into the mobile development space.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an API using Laravel and from time to time, I help out with the mobile apps for my day job.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the Spring framework, mainly just because I like learning new things and don't want my Kotlin skills to go to waste.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Japanese, with the lofty goal of being able to read Japanese manga (and maybe one day visit Japan).
- âš¡ Fun fact #1: I love learning new things regarding programming and always looking to try new programming languages and frameworks.
- âš¡ Fun fact #2: I'm an otaku who likes to watch anime and read manga.
  - *Bonus Fact:* My favorite character is Tomoko Kuroki.

I'm currently considering a couple ideas for side projects to work on, both sound rather interesting, but I've yet to decide which one I'll work on first, stay tuned.
