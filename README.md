### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer in Grand Rapids, MI, I've been programming since 2001 when I was in high school and professionally since 2009. I first started with web design, then moved into web development and now I've moved into the mobile development space.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Android development as well as making a platform for creators
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin & Swift as I port my companies Xamarin app to a native app
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love learning new things regarding programming and always looking to try new languages
